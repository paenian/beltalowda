Large Beltesian 3D printer - that is a cartesian with a belt-driven Z axis.

# Status: Working! in testing.

# Todo:
 - Top Rail - add a top rail on the other end of the Y beam, and double-up the X axis motors.  While it works, the machine isn't rigid enough at the top end of the Y rail.  Works fine for ~100mm tall parts, but more would be better.
 
 - Thicker bed surface, test other surfaces - the bed isn't quite rigid enough.  Making it thicker should help.  Joining, bending and moving a thicker belt aren't the easiest, but hopefully there's a happy mediun somewhere.
